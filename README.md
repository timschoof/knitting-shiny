# DSDX Knitting Pattern

This knitting pattern is a submission for the [Data Science By Design Anthology](http://datasciencebydesign.org/grants). The pattern is designed to visceralize how often mothers still die in childbirth around the world and is based on data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality). 

The original pattern assumes a knitting speed of 20 stitches per minute. However, if you are a faster or slower knitter, you can personalize the pattern based on your own knitting speed using this Shiny app. This will give you a knitting experience that will more closely match the rate of maternal deaths reflected in the pattern. The Shiny app also allows you to specify whether you want to knit the pattern in the round, using circular needles, or as a regular scarf, stitching the ends together at the end. Lastly, you can choose whether you want the bobbles regularly spaced, or whether you want to add a bit of jitter to the data.
